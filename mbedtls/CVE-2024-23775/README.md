# CVE-2024-23775

mbedtls_x509_set_extension 函数只在 mbedtls 的 cli 程序中被调用，tls 服务不受影响。

When writing x509 extensions we failed to validate inputs passed in to mbedtls_x509_set_extension(), which could result in an integer overflow, causing a zero-length buffer to be allocated to hold the extension. The extension would then be copied into the buffer, causing a heap buffer overflow.
