# CVE-2022-42905

配置了一个 flag 之后，client 发送 ClientHello。

[](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/11)

If wolfSSL callback functions are enabled (i.e., the flag `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` is
enabled), then a malicious client or network attacker can send a Client Hello
message to a server that when parsed by the server will trigger a buffer
over-read on the heap of at least 5 bytes. Similarly, a malicious server or a
network attacker can send a Hello Retry Request message to a client that when
parsed by the client will trigger a buffer over-read on the heap of at least 15
bytes.
